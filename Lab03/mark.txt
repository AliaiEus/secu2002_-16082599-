notes:
-in swap.py, no need to set z = '' outside body of if statement
-in hangman.py, the main issue seems to be that the if statements are outside
 the body of the while loop, so things weren't getting added to guessed.
 i've updated the code with appropriate indentation so there is something 
 working now. i'd prefer to see the commenting in line with the code,
 especially because the code is really similar to one i found on the internet 
 (http://www.canyoucompute.co.uk/uploads/1/4/2/4/14249012/05_hangman.pdf). for
 now i'm just taking off a mark but please don't do this in the future
